## Getting Started

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies and
environment. Run the following command to setup developing environment.

```sh
poetry install --no-root
```

Remember to activate the virtual environment if not automatically loaded.

```sh
source ./assignment5/.venv/bin/activate
```

## Scripts
